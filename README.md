# 100 Days of Code Counter

Once upon a time there was a man, and that man couldn't be assed to count how many days had passed since he had begun the 100 Days of Code challenge. It was day 10, as it happens, but that's not important. What's important is that he wrote this script to keep track for him. He stuck it in his `~/bin` and runs it from his `.bashrc` on login, and he lived happily ever after.
